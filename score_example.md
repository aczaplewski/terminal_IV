cash is coming from, need an in or out asap. 

Overheard an exchange on comms 10-15 mins ago, dropped the audio on the bulletin 
board. Distress call from transport ship, operated by some haulier I've not 
heard of - "Jupiter-Trojan" - inbound from outer Solar System.

Took less than 5 mins to spearphish some poor sucker @ the S.A. for the flight
plan and goods manifest, it's a big old ship carrying a LOT of 
immunosuppressants for delivery to AlphaPharma the day after tomorrow.

Btw when I say it's carrying a LOT of immunosuppresant? I mean a LOT a lot. 
looks like AlphaPharma's entire supply for the coming month was on that ship, 
what's up with THAT? Price of immunostabs about to go through the effing HULL. 

If delayed the full week, half the chromeheads on the station are gonna go into 
withdrawal unless there's some super-secret stockpile we don't know about (hope
not). 

Either way, there's $$$ in this for us - have put in a purchase order to for all
we can afford before the news travels, but we can do one better than that; Alpha
are bringing in-date stock from their warehouses uptether into the station by
train. Let's klep it and fence it once the price sky-rockets. I have a plan,
bring your crap and I'll fill you in. Leela doesn't like the odds but when does
she ever? If we make it out in one piece, first thing I'm doing is deleting the
coward data from her training set hahaha

Aside: isn't it strange that they chose not to dump cargo as usual? Can't 
believe it's worth it for the delay and the cost of the rescue/insurance hike.
Their "unseal in case of pirates" orders must have said not to dump, mega sus,
what are they carrying that's not on the paperwork? I made twofish drop what
he's working on and look into it so we'll see what he can dig up.

All the usual greetings,,
   Aes x

oh btw gotta move fast on this so I'm assuming you're in unless you lmk
otherwise. all being well we move tonight. If we heard about this others will 
have too, gotta beat them to the punch!!

# PLANNING & ENGAGEMENT

The crew has chosen the "blitz" plan type. The idea is to get onboard
the train, grab the immunostabs, and extract before their adversaries can react.
They named the train as the target, and an AV they hired from a second-hand
vehicle dealer contact as the extraction method.  

"So we need to roll to see if we get the AV?" Twofish's player asks.

"No no, you're already in the AV. We're rolling to see if it's any good or not!
He told you he wanted it back in one piece, right Twofish?"

"Yeah, and I told him 'no promises'. Anyway, if this heist works out, we can
afford not to get the deposit back... so this is an **acquire** command?"

It is. The crew spends a credit from the crew's pool and Twofish's player makes
an Acquire Asset roll as set out in the **acquire** command. As a Tier II crew,
they roll 2d and get a 4: a quality-2 "good" AV. They grab a "Special Item:
Vehicle" sheet for it and quickly fill out just enough to get a sketch of what
they're travelling in. Other details can wait until they become relevant.

It's an ex-corporate synchro-van, formerly owned by a window-cleaning company and
still painted in their livery. It's got a good amount of cargo space and it's
powered by a pair of strong Rolls-Martin turboshaft jet engines.
