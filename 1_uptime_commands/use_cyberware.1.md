_If_ you step in to **protect** a teammate from a consequence, _then_ you suffer the consequence instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.


Cyberware is a category of ability. 

Cyber abilities are better than other abilities because they give you access to The Cyber Die, which is a permanent +1d to any actions leveraging your enhancements. Cyberware abilities therefore give you new fictional permissions AND +1d in one package, which other abilities don’t tend to do. Cyber stuff exhibits precision, processing power, and regular power beyond human limits, and the Cyber Die reflects this.

Cybernetic abilities also never require stress. Stress is a human thing. Cyber is the machine. Cyber abilities therefore aren’t draining your stress pool directly (though consequences from cyber abilities, where the human side has to step in and sort stuff out, might). 

Cyber abilities are worse than other abilities because having cyberware fucks your body up unless you keep it suppressed with immunostabs, and immunostabs are expensive, and the more cyberware you have the more immunostabs you need. Everyone has a Chrome Clock that represents how much cyberware your body can take before it gives up. Usually it starts as, like, a 6-clock. 

Three types of cyberware. Class C is common or cosmetic or addresses a disability and grants no additional advantage. Legal, free in game terms, we don’t track it. 

Class B is the kind of stuff that’s “always on”. The Kerenzikov that makes your perception of time slow to a crawl so nobody ever gets the jump on you. The optical scanners passively detecting threats. The gorilla arms that just mean your arms are metal now. That kind of stuff. Class B cyberware doesn’t need activating, it’s just there. It exerts a constant strain on your body just to have this stuff, so for each one of these implants you have, permanently fill in a section of your Chrome Clock. 

You can add the Cyber Die to the pool for any action that involves this cyberware in any way. It functions just like any other die, except when it comes up as a 6, something good happens. Extra effect, mark xp, an additional advantage, that kind of bonus. Idk haven’t figured out what exactly yet, not important. 

Class A cyberware is the super duper illegal military shit - your sandevistans and bezerks and whatever. It gives you very strong abilities for a defined time span. It will also fuck you up at a much higher rate than the slightly more pedestrian Class B cyberware. When you roll the Cyber Die while this ability is active, in addition to the good thing that happens if you roll a 6, its downside is active too: on a 1-3, tick your chrome clock. When your chrome clock fills, the stress the chrome places on your body gets too much and you hit Chrome Overload and start throwing up blood everywhere; finish up whatever action you were using your cyberware for, and then you’re out of action for the rest of the current scene. 

The worst part? The more cyberware you get, the more immunosuppressants you pump into your system, the less and less they work. Haven’t exactly worked out how this bit works yet - something along the lines of the more cyberware you have the smaller your clock gets (6 to 4 to 2 to 0) so the more frequently you get Overloaded and the more and more immunostabs you need to keep functioning. And immunostabs cost. At a certain level you have to be putting so many resources into immunostabs that if you’re not raking it in you’re not going to be able to keep up. 

If you keep chroming and keep chroming, and the size of your chrome clock drops to zero, you’ll need to expend immunostabs to activate your abilities at all, and if you have any class B cyberware, you’ll be in deficit (the number of sections of the clock permanently filled by that cyberware is greater than the number of sections on the clock in the first place). Overload while in deficit and all the immunostabs in the world won’t snap you out of it - you’ll need an emergency visit to the ripperdoc to get all that chrome out of you or you’ll be needing a new character sheet.
