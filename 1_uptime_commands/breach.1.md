# NAME
breach - breach the protections of tough cybersystems 

# SYNOPSIS
**breach** [*ARGUMENT*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you step in to **protect** a teammate from a consequence, _then_ you suffer the consequence instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.



only for like, whole networks or tough ICE
this is like a mini engagement roll I guess to bust a cybersystem open








Choose an objective (e.g. “execute a payload”)



Make a plan to execute the objective, e.g.
Map the network
Find a vulnerability to exploit
Exploit the vulnerability 
Escalate your privileges
Execute the payload


How are you approaching this hack? 

    Zero day or CVE
    Social Engineering
    On-premise incursion
    Brute force
    Novel hack

Build initial ToT pool 
1. Start with the initial ToT pool provided by your cyberdeck
2. Add or subtract 1ToT for each level of quality the cybersystem is higher or lower than your Tier, and taking into account any bonuses from abilities, cyberware and equipment
3. Add/subtract ToT to reflect particular advantages or disadvantages (e.g. you flatlined one of their best netrunners in a recent op, so take +1ToT, but they’re running ICE modelled on analysis of your past attacks: -1ToT, so your advantage is cancelled out)






If your dice pool ends up at or below zero, you are instantly made the moment you enter the cybersystem, which won’t be great for you




Spend ToT to take actions to advance through each stage of the plan, or trigger runtime Programs to do it without spending ToT 
E.g. do an Analyse action to map the network, tick a box on your Cyberdeck to deploy a Program to automatically scan for vulnerabilities 


If you ever run out of ToT and are still in the run, the ICE gets you. Bad things happen




Edge cases
Actions without spending ToT (rushed): desperate/limited?
Multiple runners
Exiting without spending ToT - physical damage, metadata left behind, etc
What if you leave the cybersystem then come back? 
Establish long-term control??
