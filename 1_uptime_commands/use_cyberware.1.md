# NAME
protect - suffer a consequence for a teammate

# SYNOPSIS
**protect** [*TEAMMATE*]... [*CONSEQUENCE*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you step in to **protect** a teammate from a consequence, _then_ you suffer the consequence instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.


Cyberware is a category of ability. 

Cyber abilities are better than other abilities because they give you access to The Cyber Die, which is a permanent +1d to any actions leveraging your enhancements. Cyberware abilities therefore give you new fictional permissions AND +1d in one package, which other abilities don’t tend to do. Cyber stuff exhibits precision, processing power, and regular power beyond human limits, and the Cyber Die reflects this.

Cybernetic abilities also never require stress. Stress is a human thing. Cyber is the machine. Cyber abilities therefore aren’t draining your stress pool directly (though consequences from cyber abilities, where the human side has to step in and sort stuff out, might). 

Cyber abilities are worse than other abilities because having cyberware fucks your body up unless you keep it suppressed with immunostabs, and immunostabs are expensive, and the more cyberware you have the more immunostabs you need. Everyone has a Chrome Clock that represents how much cyberware your body can take before it gives up. Usually it starts as, like, a 6-clock. 

Three types of cyberware. Class C is common or cosmetic or addresses a disability and grants no additional advantage. Legal, free in game terms, we don’t track it. 

Class B is the kind of stuff that’s “always on”. The Kerenzikov that makes your perception of time slow to a crawl so nobody ever gets the jump on you. The optical scanners passively detecting threats. The gorilla arms that just mean your arms are metal now. That kind of stuff. Class B cyberware doesn’t need activating, it’s just there. It exerts a constant strain on your body just to have this stuff, so for each one of these implants you have, permanently fill in a section of your Chrome Clock. 

You can add the Cyber Die to the pool for any action that involves this cyberware in any way. It functions just like any other die, except when it comes up as a 6, something good happens. Extra effect, mark xp, an additional advantage, that kind of bonus. Idk haven’t figured out what exactly yet, not important. 

Class A cyberware is the super duper illegal military shit - your sandevistans and bezerks and whatever. It gives you very strong abilities for a defined time span. It will also fuck you up at a much higher rate than the slightly more pedestrian Class B cyberware. When you roll the Cyber Die while this ability is active, in addition to the good thing that happens if you roll a 6, its downside is active too: on a 1-3, tick your chrome clock. When your chrome clock fills, the stress the chrome places on your body gets too much and you hit Chrome Overload and start throwing up blood everywhere; finish up whatever action you were using your cyberware for, and then you’re out of action for the rest of the current scene. 

The worst part? The more cyberware you get, the more immunosuppressants you pump into your system, the less and less they work. Haven’t exactly worked out how this bit works yet - something along the lines of the more cyberware you have the smaller your clock gets (6 to 4 to 2 to 0) so the more frequently you get Overloaded and the more and more immunostabs you need to keep functioning. And immunostabs cost. At a certain level you have to be putting so many resources into immunostabs that if you’re not raking it in you’re not going to be able to keep up. 

If you keep chroming and keep chroming, and the size of your chrome clock drops to zero, you’ll need to expend immunostabs to activate your abilities at all, and if you have any class B cyberware, you’ll be in deficit (the number of sections of the clock permanently filled by that cyberware is greater than the number of sections on the clock in the first place). Overload while in deficit and all the immunostabs in the world won’t snap you out of it - you’ll need an emergency visit to the ripperdoc to get all that chrome out of you or you’ll be needing a new character sheet.











NOTES


"What's going chrome? It's when you push the metal you're carrying. The metal tang of electricity on the roof of your mouth as the wiring goes to higher voltage. The glow just under your skin as the heat starts diffusing from the batteries you had to store in your bones, the warm buzz of the painkillers that get flushed into your system to help you ignore the micro-tears of limbs moving too fast so you can perform at peak. It's the good cyberpunk shit." -- Stras "Crashcircuit" A.

Class C Cyberware

Fits into one of three categories:
Cosmetic customisations - may come up in the fiction, but has no mechanical effect. 
Cyberware which addresses a disability - for example, an artificial limb or neural implant to relieve migraines.
Cyberware which provides basic interface functionality common to all citizens of Terminal IV - chipware and interface sockets for interoperability, net connectivity hardware, etc. 
Class C cyberware is legal and not controlled by Terminal IV’s authorities.
Players don’t need to declare their characters have Class C cyberware during character creation - it’s fine to bring it up as it becomes relevant in play. 
There’s usually no cost associated with Class C cyberware; however, If a character needs to acquire some and it’s been established in the fiction that they didn’t already have it (e.g. if their leg gets blown off and they need a cybernetic replacement) they will have to acquire it in a way that makes fictional sense, which may incur a cost.

Class B Cyberware

Cyberware which provides “always-on” passive abilities falls under Class B. 
Examples include “Kiroshi”-style optics which enhance vision and “Kerenzikov”-style reflex-enhancing nervous system implants
Class B cyberware is controlled by Terminal IV’s authorities and questionably legal. It’s certainly not legal when jailbroken.

Class A Cyberware

Cyberware which provides immediate/active abilities falls under Class A. 
Examples include “Berserk” and “Sandevistan”-style spinal implants, and most kinds of weaponry implants (“Gorilla Arms”, “Mantis Blades”, etc)
This stuff’s super illegal; even just having it will draw suspicion
The system for making this stuff feel dangerous and special hinges on it activating the Cyber Die 

The Class B Problem

For abilities that grant passive abilities/fictional permissions to do something you couldn’t already do, there isn’t necessarily a die roll, and it doesn’t make sense to roll the Cyber Die and risk a complication from something that was already going on in the background anyway
E.g. the Kerenzikov:
It works by permanently slowing down the user’s perception of time so they can react to danger faster, because it appears to happen in slow motion
The character has to adjust to this - it’s obviously a huge change to deliberately slow your speech to sound normal to others etc
It makes no sense to roll the cyber die to use the Kerenzikov, because the Kerenzikov is always active
How do we make the Kerenzikov meaningfully different from… just having really good reflexes?? See the Lurk ability “Reflexes” from BITD:

Reflexes
When there’s a question about who acts first, the answer is you.
This ability gives you the initiative in most situations. Some specially trained
NPCs (and some demons and spirits) might also have reflexes, but otherwise,
you’re always the first to act, and can interrupt anyone else who tries to beat
you to the punch. This ability usually doesn’t negate the need to make an
action roll that you would otherwise have to make, but it may improve your
position or effect.


















Class B Cyberware:

“Kerenzikov” 

A neural implant that grants you superhuman reflexes by slowing down the rate at which you perceive time passing. When there’s a question about who acts first, the answer is you. 


A sucker’s speedware isn’t going to help them if you can react before they get a chance to activate it. You’re going to have to get used to tal

Class C Cyberware: Roll the Cyber Die

Spinal Speedware “Sandevistan”

For a few moments, your body is capable of superhuman speed. Your nerves fire faster, your muscles respond more quickly, and you perceive time as passing at a fraction of the normal rate. 

From your point of view, you will move and interact with the environment as usual; it will appear, however, that bullets travel at a walking pace and people are almost completely frozen in time (unless they’re packing their own speedware). From an observer’s point of view, your movements will be too fast to resolve anything more than a blur without employing some kind of time-screwing drugs or chrome. 

The effect lasts until the implant overheats and cuts out, a few moments after activation; you’ll have to wait a few minutes for the implant to cool before attempting to activate it again. There’s no thermal cut-out on these things, so go ahead and try firing it up right away if you don’t mind your spinal cord getting fried on the spot.


Upgrades:

Enhanced Heatsink 

Better cooling enables you to reactivate the implant after a few moments as opposed to a few minutes. You’d better believe you’re voiding your warranty, though, and you can’t keep pushing the heat sinks like that without consequences: make a 4-clock called “Catastrophic Overheat” and tick it for every operation in which this ability was used. 

Qubit Processor 

An experimental next-gen processor that leverages quantum weirdness to make you move optimally every single time. A sentence about what this does mechanically goes here (position/effect stuff). 

On this palm-sized chip there’s enough quantum compute power to simulate every single possible movement path in a fraction of a second. It interfaces with your optics to assess the situation and collapse down all the potential actions to just one, which it instructs your muscles to then execute. Of course, the chip can only optimise whatever plan you were visualising when you activated the Sandevistan; if you chose a bad plan in the first place, well, there’s not much cyberware can do to help with that. 

Plug it right into your Sandevistan’s processor socket and make sure the thermal paste is well-applied, because this thing runs hot. If you’re chipping it without having upgraded the stock heatsinks, then Christ, good luck to you.
