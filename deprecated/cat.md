# terminal_IV

This is the public repo for the tabletop rpg "Terminal_IV" by Kat and Alasdair.
We're experimenting with hosting the game here on github during the playtest
process, and will be gradually uploading rules text.

this game is a work v much in progress!! feedback is welcomed. 

## get in touch

mastodon [@puns_and_ships@dice.camp](https://dice.camp/@puns_and_ships) / discord Puns_and_ships#8105

## terminal_IV game design principles:

### Framework-First Design

To reflect the game's DIY "hacker" ethos, frameworks for writing custom abilities, items, etc will be presented front-and-centre. Wherever possible, lists will be presented as examples/quick-start options for new players rather than prescribed choices. 
The "Hacking The Game" section will be split up into robust question-and-answer-based frameworks for hacking each individual part of the game.

### Modular Rules

Inspired by the Unix philosophy, terminal_IV's rules will be minimal and
modular, split into bite-sized discrete self-contained sections inspired by PBTA moves with clear triggers; players need only engage with rules with trigger conditions that are currently active. 

### T_IV's Not BITD
...but it shouldn't introduce too many minor rules alterations to keep track of. We aim to introduce departures from the original BITD ruleset judiciously to maximise the impact of the major changes while minimising the amount of subtle deviations players will have to remember.

There'll be more, but it's these three for now.

Took less than 5 to spearphish some poor sucker @ the S.A. for the flight plan
and goods manifest, it's a big old ship carrying a LOT of immunosuppresants for 
delivery to AlphaPharma the day after tomorrow.

Btw when I say it's carrying a LOT of immunosuppresant? I mean a LOT a lot. 
looks like AlphaPharma's entire supply for the coming month was on that ship, 
what's up with THAT? Price of immunostabs about to go through the effing HULL. 

If delayed the full week, half the chromeheads on the station are gonna go into 
withdrawal unless there's some super-secret stockpile we don't know about (hope
not). 

Either way, there's $$$ in this for us - have put in a purchase order to for all 
we can afford before the news travels, but we can do one better than that - 
Alpha have in-date stock still at their warehouses, let's klep it and fence it 
once the price sky-rockets. I have a plan, bring your crap and I'll fill you in.
Leela doesn't like the odds but when does she ever? If we make it out in one
piece, first thing I'm doing is deleting the coward data from her training set
hahaha

Aside: isn't it strange that they chose not to dump cargo as usual? Can't 
believe it's worth it for the delay and the cost of the rescue/insurance hike.
Their "unseal in case of pirates" orders must have said not to dump, mega sus,
what are they carrying that's not on the paperwork? I made twofish drop what
he's working on and look into it so we'll see what he can dig up.

All the usual greetings,,
   Aes x

oh btw gotta move fast on this so I'm assuming you're in unless you lmk
otherwise. all being well we move tonight. If we heard about this others will 
have too, gotta beat them to the punch!!

# NAME
act -  attempt something challenging and dangerous

# SYNOPSIS
**act** [*OBJECTIVE*]... [*ACTION*]... [**-S** *skill* | **-P** *specialty* | **-M** *mastery*] [**-c|r|d** *position options*] [**-z|l|s|g|x** *effect options*] [**-B** *boost*] [**-C** *cyber*] [**-p** *push*] [**-t** *trade*] [*RESOLUTION*]... [**-R** *resist*]

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ your character takes challenging and dangerous action, _then_ you make an **action roll** to see how it turns out. 

An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to your PC’s goal, and it’s dangerous if something bad could happen if you failed (or failed to act). If the action is something we’d expect the character to simply accomplish, then it just happens; we don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. How exactly your group defines what "challenging" and “dangerous” mean will help establish the tone and style of your Terminal_IV series.

You don't get to do an action roll until we actually see your character take daring action on-screen. In Apocalypse World parlance: "to do it, do it". 

## ABOUT THE ACTION ROLL
The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well your character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a 6), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a 4-5), or it might just all go wrong (on a 1-3).

Since NPCs don't roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a 6, the PC wins and has their effect. On a 4/5, it's a mix; both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a 1-3, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.

## THE DICE POOL

Your Action Roll dice pool may comprise up to 3 **Action Dice** (the Skill, Specialty, Mastery dice) plus the **Boost Die** and the **Cyber Die** for a maximum of 5d. You can still attempt an action roll with 0d in your dice pool (see step 6 and good luck). 

The 6 processes to build the pool, roll, and interpret the results are as follows:

# 1: OBJECTIVE (YOU OWN THIS PROCESS)
State your objective: the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand.
 
Usually the character's objective is obvious in context, but it's the Admin’s job to ask questions to clarify when necessary.

# 2: CHOOSE AN ACTION AND BUILD INITIAL DICE POOL (YOU OWN THIS PROCESS)
Choose the action rating that best fits the action your character is taking in the fiction. 

The same fictional action may be covered by more than one action rating, by design; the action rating you choose determines how your action is presented "on-screen". For example: stabbing someone with **Burn** may centre passion and anger; with **Execute**, precision and speed; with **Bruteforce**, well- you can work that one out. 

Add a number of dice to your dice pool based on your skill level in that action rating:

**-S** **--skill**
: This is an action you're skilled at. Add **1d**: the **Skill Die**.

**-P**, **--specialty**
: This is your specialty. Add **2d**: the **Skill Die** and **Specialty Die**.

**-M**, **--mastery**
: You are widely acknowledged as a master in this field. Add **3d**: the **Skill Die**, **Specialty Die**, and **Mastery Die**.

You set your starting skill levels in the various action ratings during **character creation** and upgrade them through **character advancement**.

# 3: POSITION OPTIONS (ADMIN OWNS THIS PROCESS)
The Admin sets the **position** for the roll. The position represents how dangerous the action is and how screwed you are if things go wrong. By default, an action roll is risky. 

**-c**, **--controlled**
: You act on your terms. You exploit a dominant advantage.

**-r**, **--risky**
: You go head to head. You act under fire. You take a chance.

**-d**, **--desperate**
: You overreach your capabilities. You’re in serious trouble. At least you get to **mark XP**.

## ABOUT POSITION

# 4: EFFECT OPTIONS (ADMIN OWNS THIS PROCESS)
The Admin assesses the likely **effect level** of this action, given the situation; "how much" can this action accomplish? Effect levels from low to high:

**-z**, **--zero**
: You’re trying to do something currently impossible.

**-l**, **--limited**	
: 1 tick; you achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished? What effort remains to achieve your goal?

**-s**, **--standard**	
: 2 ticks; you achieve what we’d expect as “normal” with this action. Is that enough, or is there more to do?

**-g**, **--great**
: 3 ticks; you achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest? What additional benefits do you enjoy?

**-x**, **--extreme**
: 5 ticks; beyond great effect. You rule this scene. 

## ABOUT EFFECT

# 5: OTHER OPTIONS (YOU OWN THIS PROCESS)
**-B --boost**
: Add the **Boost Die** to your dice pool, by **pushing yourself** for a boost, accepting **assistance**, or making a **devil's bargain** (choose 1).

**-C --cyber**
: Add the **Cyber Die** to your dice pool by **leveraging cyberware**.

**-p --push**
: **Push yourself** to increase your effect level.

**-t --trade**
: Trade position for effect, or vice versa. 

# 6: RESOLVE THE ACTION ROLL (YOU AND THE ADMIN JOINTLY OWN THIS PROCESS)
Roll your dice pool. 

If you've got to this step and you still have 0d in your pool, then roll 2d and keep the lowest result (obviously, you can't crit). Sure, 97% of the time you'll face a consequence, but 25% of the time you'll get a success too; on Terminal_IV, 1 in 4 is still pretty good odds. 

## EXIT VALUES
 
**00**	66+	Crit Success		Success, with increased effect!
	
**0**	6	Full Success		You succeed in your action!
	
**1**	4-5	Partial Success		You succeed, but there are consequences
	
**2**	1-3	Bad Outcome	    	You fail, and there are consequences

## INTERPRETING THE RESULTS 
The Admin will judge the **effects** and **consequences** resulting from the roll as below:

**CONTROLLED POSITION**
You act on your terms. You exploit a dominant advantage.

**66+**: Critical! You do it with increased effect.

**6**:   You do it.

**4-5**: You hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach, or else do it with a minor consequence: a minor complication occurs, you have reduced effect, you suffer lesser harm, you end up in a risky position.

**1-3**: You falter. Press on by seizing a risky opportunity, or withdraw and try a different approach.

Consequences here are less immediately dangerous, reflecting that you're acting from a position of control.

**RISKY POSITION**
You go head to head. You act under fire. You take a chance.

**66+**: Critical! You do it with increased effect.

**6**:   You do it.

**4-5**: You do it, but there's a consequence: you suffer harm, a complication occurs, you have reduced effect, you end up in a desperate position.

**1-3**: Things go badly. You suffer harm, a complication occurs, you end up in a desperate position, you lose this opportunity.

**DESPERATE POSITION**
You overreach your capabilities. You're in serious trouble.

**66+**: Critical! You do it with increased effect.

**6**:   You do it.

**4-5**: You do it, but there's a consequence: you suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you have reduced effect.

**1-3**: It's the worst outcome. You suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you lose this opportunity for action.

On a 1-3, it's up to the Admin to decide if the PC's action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a 1-3 result.

Consequences - REWRITE THIS BIT
When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it's called a consequence. Consequences are the companion to effects. PCs have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face.

Each 4-5 and 1-3 outcome lists suggested consequences for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these consequences, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by resisting them.

# NOTE
In no circumstances may your dice pool for the action roll exceed 5d unless, you've hacked together some questionably-balanced custom ability that lets you do that and your Admin actually approved it, in which case that's a you problem. 



















# TO DO:


When you narrate the action after the roll, you and the Admin collaborate to say what happens on-screen. Use the following table as a guide:


Include notes on dice roll probability 

"effects in the fiction"/"why we do this" sections etc not in the SRD


Effect
In Blades in the Dark, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the effect level of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand -- great, standard, or limited? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you're using a progress clock.
Effect Levels



Assessing Factors
To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: potency, scale, and quality. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.
Potency
The potency factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk, or the influence of arcane powers. An infiltrator is more potent if all the lights are extinguished and they move about in the dark.
Quality/Tier
Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by Tier. Fine items count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier.
Thorn is picking the lock to a safehouse run of a gang renowned for Occult dealings. Her crew is Tier I and she has fine lock picks - so she's effectively Tier II. The Occult gang is Tier III. Thorn is outclassed in quality, so her effect will be limited on the lock.
Scale
Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.
When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in zero effect—or increased beyond great, resulting in an extreme effect.
If a PC special ability gives "+1 effect," it comes into play after the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Cutter's Bodyguard ability would bump them up to limited effect.
Also, remember that a PC can push themselves (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action.
Every factor won't always apply to every situation. You don't have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call—don't feel beholden to them.












Setting Position & Effect
The GM sets position and effect for an action roll at the same time, after the player says what they're doing and chooses their action. Usually, Risky / Standard is the default combination, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and the effect factors.
The ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances.
For example, if a character is facing off alone against a small enemy gang, the situation might be:
She fights the gang straight up, rushing into their midst, hacking away in a wild Skirmish. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the gang reduces her effect (Desperate / Limited).
She fights the gang from a choke-point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can't overwhelm her at once. She's not threatened by several at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there's still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced (Risky / Limited).
She doesn't fight the gang, instead trying to maneuver her way past them and escape. She's still under threat from many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the gang can't easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn't reduced (Desperate / Standard). If she had some immediate means of escape (like leaping onto a speeding carriage), then her effect might even be increased (Desperate / Great).
The gang isn't aware of her yet—she's set up in a sniper position on a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren't a factor, so her effect isn't reduced, and she's not immediately in any danger (Controlled / Great). Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole gang, in which case their scale applies (Controlled / Limited). If the gang is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous (Risky / Great). If the gang is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover (Risky / Limited). If the gang is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our scoundrel (Desperate / Limited).

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you step in to **protect** a teammate from a consequence, _then_ you suffer the consequence instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.



only for like, whole networks or tough ICE
this is like a mini engagement roll I guess to bust a cybersystem open








Choose an objective (e.g. “execute a payload”)



Make a plan to execute the objective, e.g.
Map the network
Find a vulnerability to exploit
Exploit the vulnerability 
Escalate your privileges
Execute the payload


How are you approaching this hack?

    Social Engineering
    On-premise incursion
    Brute force
    Novel hack

via DMRawlings






Build initial ToT pool 
1. Start with the initial ToT pool provided by your cyberdeck
2. Add or subtract 1ToT for each level of quality the cybersystem is higher or lower than your Tier, and taking into account any bonuses from abilities, cyberware and equipment
3. Add/subtract ToT to reflect particular advantages or disadvantages (e.g. you flatlined one of their best netrunners in a recent op, so take +1ToT, but they’re running ICE modelled on analysis of your past attacks: -1ToT, so your advantage is cancelled out)






If your dice pool ends up at or below zero, you are instantly made the moment you enter the cybersystem, which won’t be great for you




Spend ToT to take actions to advance through each stage of the plan, or trigger runtime Programs to do it without spending ToT 
E.g. do an Analyse action to map the network, tick a box on your Cyberdeck to deploy a Program to automatically scan for vulnerabilities 


If you ever run out of ToT and are still in the run, the ICE gets you. Bad things happen




Edge cases
Actions without spending ToT (rushed): desperate/limited?
Multiple runners
Exiting without spending ToT - physical damage, metadata left behind, etc
What if you leave the cybersystem then come back? 
Establish long-term control??

Cyberware is a category of ability. 

Cyber abilities are better than other abilities because they give you access to The Cyber Die, which is a permanent +1d to any actions leveraging your enhancements. Cyberware abilities therefore give you new fictional permissions AND +1d in one package, which other abilities don’t tend to do. Cyber stuff exhibits precision, processing power, and regular power beyond human limits, and the Cyber Die reflects this.

Cybernetic abilities also never require stress. Stress is a human thing. Cyber is the machine. Cyber abilities therefore aren’t draining your stress pool directly (though consequences from cyber abilities, where the human side has to step in and sort stuff out, might). 

Cyber abilities are worse than other abilities because having cyberware fucks your body up unless you keep it suppressed with immunostabs, and immunostabs are expensive, and the more cyberware you have the more immunostabs you need. Everyone has a Chrome Clock that represents how much cyberware your body can take before it gives up. Usually it starts as, like, a 6-clock. 

Three types of cyberware. Class C is common or cosmetic or addresses a disability and grants no additional advantage. Legal, free in game terms, we don’t track it. 

Class B is the kind of stuff that’s “always on”. The Kerenzikov that makes your perception of time slow to a crawl so nobody ever gets the jump on you. The optical scanners passively detecting threats. The gorilla arms that just mean your arms are metal now. That kind of stuff. Class B cyberware doesn’t need activating, it’s just there. It exerts a constant strain on your body just to have this stuff, so for each one of these implants you have, permanently fill in a section of your Chrome Clock. 

You can add the Cyber Die to the pool for any action that involves this cyberware in any way. It functions just like any other die, except when it comes up as a 6, something good happens. Extra effect, mark xp, an additional advantage, that kind of bonus. Idk haven’t figured out what exactly yet, not important. 

Class A cyberware is the super duper illegal military shit - your sandevistans and bezerks and whatever. It gives you very strong abilities for a defined time span. It will also fuck you up at a much higher rate than the slightly more pedestrian Class B cyberware. When you roll the Cyber Die while this ability is active, in addition to the good thing that happens if you roll a 6, its downside is active too: on a 1-3, tick your chrome clock. When your chrome clock fills, the stress the chrome places on your body gets too much and you hit Chrome Overload and start throwing up blood everywhere; finish up whatever action you were using your cyberware for, and then you’re out of action for the rest of the current scene. 

The worst part? The more cyberware you get, the more immunosuppressants you pump into your system, the less and less they work. Haven’t exactly worked out how this bit works yet - something along the lines of the more cyberware you have the smaller your clock gets (6 to 4 to 2 to 0) so the more frequently you get Overloaded and the more and more immunostabs you need to keep functioning. And immunostabs cost. At a certain level you have to be putting so many resources into immunostabs that if you’re not raking it in you’re not going to be able to keep up. 

If you keep chroming and keep chroming, and the size of your chrome clock drops to zero, you’ll need to expend immunostabs to activate your abilities at all, and if you have any class B cyberware, you’ll be in deficit (the number of sections of the clock permanently filled by that cyberware is greater than the number of sections on the clock in the first place). Overload while in deficit and all the immunostabs in the world won’t snap you out of it - you’ll need an emergency visit to the ripperdoc to get all that chrome out of you or you’ll be needing a new character sheet.











NOTES


"What's going chrome? It's when you push the metal you're carrying. The metal tang of electricity on the roof of your mouth as the wiring goes to higher voltage. The glow just under your skin as the heat starts diffusing from the batteries you had to store in your bones, the warm buzz of the painkillers that get flushed into your system to help you ignore the micro-tears of limbs moving too fast so you can perform at peak. It's the good cyberpunk shit." -- Stras "Crashcircuit" A.

Class C Cyberware

Fits into one of three categories:
Cosmetic customisations - may come up in the fiction, but has no mechanical effect. 
Cyberware which addresses a disability - for example, an artificial limb or neural implant to relieve migraines.
Cyberware which provides basic interface functionality common to all citizens of Terminal IV - chipware and interface sockets for interoperability, net connectivity hardware, etc. 
Class C cyberware is legal and not controlled by Terminal IV’s authorities.
Players don’t need to declare their characters have Class C cyberware during character creation - it’s fine to bring it up as it becomes relevant in play. 
There’s usually no cost associated with Class C cyberware; however, If a character needs to acquire some and it’s been established in the fiction that they didn’t already have it (e.g. if their leg gets blown off and they need a cybernetic replacement) they will have to acquire it in a way that makes fictional sense, which may incur a cost.

Class B Cyberware

Cyberware which provides “always-on” passive abilities falls under Class B. 
Examples include “Kiroshi”-style optics which enhance vision and “Kerenzikov”-style reflex-enhancing nervous system implants
Class B cyberware is controlled by Terminal IV’s authorities and questionably legal. It’s certainly not legal when jailbroken.

Class A Cyberware

Cyberware which provides immediate/active abilities falls under Class A. 
Examples include “Berserk” and “Sandevistan”-style spinal implants, and most kinds of weaponry implants (“Gorilla Arms”, “Mantis Blades”, etc)
This stuff’s super illegal; even just having it will draw suspicion
The system for making this stuff feel dangerous and special hinges on it activating the Cyber Die 

The Class B Problem

For abilities that grant passive abilities/fictional permissions to do something you couldn’t already do, there isn’t necessarily a die roll, and it doesn’t make sense to roll the Cyber Die and risk a complication from something that was already going on in the background anyway
E.g. the Kerenzikov:
It works by permanently slowing down the user’s perception of time so they can react to danger faster, because it appears to happen in slow motion
The character has to adjust to this - it’s obviously a huge change to deliberately slow your speech to sound normal to others etc
It makes no sense to roll the cyber die to use the Kerenzikov, because the Kerenzikov is always active
How do we make the Kerenzikov meaningfully different from… just having really good reflexes?? See the Lurk ability “Reflexes” from BITD:

Reflexes
When there’s a question about who acts first, the answer is you.
This ability gives you the initiative in most situations. Some specially trained
NPCs (and some demons and spirits) might also have reflexes, but otherwise,
you’re always the first to act, and can interrupt anyone else who tries to beat
you to the punch. This ability usually doesn’t negate the need to make an
action roll that you would otherwise have to make, but it may improve your
position or effect.


















Class B Cyberware:

“Kerenzikov” 

A neural implant that grants you superhuman reflexes by slowing down the rate at which you perceive time passing. When there’s a question about who acts first, the answer is you. 


A sucker’s speedware isn’t going to help them if you can react before they get a chance to activate it. You’re going to have to get used to tal

Class C Cyberware: Roll the Cyber Die

Spinal Speedware “Sandevistan”

For a few moments, your body is capable of superhuman speed. Your nerves fire faster, your muscles respond more quickly, and you perceive time as passing at a fraction of the normal rate. 

From your point of view, you will move and interact with the environment as usual; it will appear, however, that bullets travel at a walking pace and people are almost completely frozen in time (unless they’re packing their own speedware). From an observer’s point of view, your movements will be too fast to resolve anything more than a blur without employing some kind of time-screwing drugs or chrome. 

The effect lasts until the implant overheats and cuts out, a few moments after activation; you’ll have to wait a few minutes for the implant to cool before attempting to activate it again. There’s no thermal cut-out on these things, so go ahead and try firing it up right away if you don’t mind your spinal cord getting fried on the spot.


Upgrades:

Enhanced Heatsink 

Better cooling enables you to reactivate the implant after a few moments as opposed to a few minutes. You’d better believe you’re voiding your warranty, though, and you can’t keep pushing the heat sinks like that without consequences: make a 4-clock called “Catastrophic Overheat” and tick it for every operation in which this ability was used. 

Qubit Processor 

An experimental next-gen processor that leverages quantum weirdness to make you move optimally every single time. A sentence about what this does mechanically goes here (position/effect stuff). 

On this palm-sized chip there’s enough quantum compute power to simulate every single possible movement path in a fraction of a second. It interfaces with your optics to assess the situation and collapse down all the potential actions to just one, which it instructs your muscles to then execute. Of course, the chip can only optimise whatever plan you were visualising when you activated the Sandevistan; if you chose a bad plan in the first place, well, there’s not much cyberware can do to help with that. 

Plug it right into your Sandevistan’s processor socket and make sure the thermal paste is well-applied, because this thing runs hot. If you’re chipping it without having upgraded the stock heatsinks, then Christ, good luck to you.

# SYNOPSIS
**assist** [*TEAMMATE*]... [*ACTION*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you step up to **assist** a teammate who is taking action, _then_ you mark **1 stress** to add the **boost die** to their roll. You might also suffer any consequences of the action roll, depending on the circumstances.
 
# NOTE
Only one character may assist a given roll. If you really want to help and someone else is already assisting, consider performing a **setup** action instead. 

A character may assist when someone **leads** a group action if they aren't taking part in it directly. You decide which teammate in the group action gets the bonus die.

# NAME
lead - coordinate a group action

# SYNOPSIS
**lead** [**-c** *--cohorts*] [**-t** *teammates*] [*PARTICIPANTS*]... [*ACTION*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you coordinate multiple allies to act in concert, _then_ you take the **lead** in a group action. All participants roll; count only the single highest roll as the result of an action roll covering all participants. As the leader, take **1 stress** for each participant who rolled a 1-3 as their best result.

# OPTIONS 
**-c**, **--cohorts**
: Cohorts participate by rolling their quality level. If you’re participating alongside the cohort, roll the appropriate action; otherwise roll an action like **Connect**, **Influence**, **Burn**, etc to direct/ or inspire their efforts.

**-t**, **--teammates**
: Teammates participate by making an action roll (usually everyone rolls the same action). 

# NOTE
Your character doesn't have to be especially skilled at the action at hand in order to lead a group action. This command is about leadership, not necessarily about ability.

setup - take action to set teammates up for success

# SYNOPSIS
**setup** [*ACTION*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you take action to indirectly assist a teammate’s future action, _then_ you perform a **setup** action; if your action has its intended result, any ally who follows through on your action gets **+1 effect level** or **improved position** for their roll. You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

# NOTE
This is good for creating distractions; contributing to an operation when you don’t have a good rating in the action at hand; tackling opposition that has advantages in quality, scale and/or potency. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup (including someone leading a group action) as long as it makes sense in the fiction.

If you're wondering if this is _really_ a rule in its own right: it isn't, it's merely a consequence of position and effect doing its thing. This just codifies something you could do anyway as its own mechanic for convenience.

treat - tend to a teammate's harm in an emergency

# SYNOPSIS
**treat** [*TEAMMATE*]... [*ACTION*]... [*HARM*]... 

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you take action to give emergency **treatment** to a teammate for a specific **harm**, _then_ the penalty from the harm you treated counts as **one level less severe** for an hour or two. 

# NOTE
This treatment can involve repairs to flesh and chrome, in which case you're probably rolling something like **Engineer**; or hotfixes to software, in which case consider **Interface**; or perhaps you're offering mental support to a teammate who can't go on, in which case look at **Connect**.

If more than one teammate is attending to the patient, consider **leading** a group action to **treat** any number of harms up to the number of participating teammates.

In the case of emergency medical aid, always try to treat a casualty using their own IFAK - they brought one, right? Otherwise, you risk sustaining trauma yourself with your own trauma kit all used up.

[Below is a version of the cyberware creation framework found in the **chip** downtime command]



Example cyberware configuration: Ossitek_M57_Heavy_Lift_Endobrace (based off Lewys' character idea)


# 1 Imagine a cool piece of chrome that suits your character.
Don't even think about the game's mechanics at this point. Think of a cyberware idea you'd like your character to have, which they could feasibly get hold of in the fiction. Visualise it in action and hold it as an image in your head - no need to translate it to words yet. Done that?

> Yes.

# 2 Judge which category of cyberware your idea best fits into.
See the class breakdown further down this file; delete the lines that don't apply.

> Class B: "always-on" cyberware which passively offers a specific fictional permission or mechanical advantage. When your cyberware offers you an advantage during an action roll, you may **leverage cyberware** to roll the Cyber Die.  

# 3 Describe what physical form your cyberware takes and where in your body it's located
E.g. chip, artificial limb, eye implant, etc

> A reinforced skeleton; nano-fibre-woven braces and big chunks of metal surround key parts of my skeleton, supporting the joints and reinforcing the bone. My tendons and ligaments are also replaced with stronger synthetic equivalents.

# 4 Describe in one or two sentences how your cyberware affects the fiction when it's in use.
It may help to compare your character's abilities when leveraging their cyberware to normal human limits. 

> I can lift much more weight than is humanly possible, and am extremely resistant to breaking bones on blunt force impact. 

# 5 Why did you end up with this cyberware?

> It's to help me lift stuff for my construction job and generally reduce the chance of dying on site.  

# 6 How did you acquire/pay for it?

> Company paid, they take it back if you quit or get fired, though. That or you gotta pay... not a lot of ex-construction workers

# 7 Provide a detail about your cyberware's installation process

> It's pretty invasive - big old scar down my spine. They basically do the same thing you do to fish cept you got arms and legs too

# 8 Who chipped you? How well do you know them? Are you still in contact?

# 9 What kind of maintenance does your cyberware need? Do you have to see a doc for that, or can you do it yourself?

NOTE: These classes are NOT diegetic. They are a way to categorise cyberware by its mechanical costs and effects; as an in-fiction cyberware classification system it makes less than zero sense.

## Class C
Class C cyberware is mundane, legal, and not controlled by Terminal_IV's authorities. These kinds of body modifications are completely commonplace and will turn few heads. Class C cyberware includes:

- Cyberware which is completely routine in-setting, e.g. the standard neural integration/IO port suite common among Terminal_IV residents;
- Cyberware which addresses a disability and doesn't confer any significant extra fictional advantage, e.g. an artificial limb;
- Cosmetic customisations which offer no direct mechanical benefit (though they may occasionally impact position/effect), e.g. cat ears.

There’s usually no cost associated with Class C cyberware; however, if a character needs to acquire some and it’s been established in the fiction that they didn’t already have it (e.g. if their leg gets blown off and they need a cybernetic replacement) they will have to acquire it in a way that makes fictional sense, which may invole the cost of a **chip** downtime command. Outside of these edge cases, you can usually just establish in the fiction that your character has Class C cyberware whenever it becomes relevant in play; you can choose to go through the process of creating and recording it as outlined in the **chip** downtime command, but you don't have to.  

## Class B
Class B: "always-on" cyberware which passively offers a specific fictional permission or mechanical advantage. Access to Class B cyberware is often restricted by Terminal_IV's authorities, and many examples in this category are entirely illegal (doubly so if jailbroken). 

Class B2 cyberware provides the fictional effect of a physical item, but integrated into your body. 
Examples include wrist-mounted rocket launchers (which are essentially just a regular rocket launcher integrated with your body). 

Class B1 cyberware provides a fictional effect or mechanical advantage not easily accomplished with a physical item. 
Examples include

## Class A

Rules to keep in mind to get space travel that feels like it belongs in this
setting, and rules to break to show that something doesn’t play by the
established rules Space travel is set up to be difficult and dangerous, to
enhance the pressure-cooker atmosphere of Terminal_IV. Getting out is a campaign
arc in and of itself. Your players may never set foot on a spaceship all
campaign long, but these suggestions should help maintain a consistent tone; of
course, you have our permission to break them any time you feel like it. 




The Zeroth Law: Infrastructure Gets It Done Space infrastructure projects are
what made space transit economical. Any time you get a chance to put an
elevator, skyhook, accelerator, laser highway etc on-screen, do so; delta-v is
expensive (see the First Law), so rely on infrastructure for your propulsion
wherever possible.  Terminal_IV is a love letter to space infrastructure, a
celebration of what can be done when humanity comes together, and a cautionary
tale about what happens when common goods are exploited for profit. Paint the
infrastructure as an enabler of progress, an arena of corporate greed, and a
means of accumulation and exploitation. Control of infrastructure = power
(omnipotent corporations like the Phobos Hook Company and Sun Macrosystems can
confirm).  *This law’s for free as it’s foundational to the entire premise of
the setting, a space station on a space elevator. We love space infrastructure.






The First Law: Delta-v Is Expensive Whatever means of propulsion you’re using,
in order to change velocity, you need some kind of thrust, and that thrust is
non-trivial to produce. Wherever you’re getting the energy from, whether it’s an
on-board fuel source or external, treat it like it’s precious.  This will mean
journeys take careful planning in advance; it may be advantageous to delay your
departure until your destination is in a good position (e.g. for a low-energy
Hohmann transfer); you’re likely not carrying much more fuel than is needed for
your mission plan as mass reduces efficiency; if you realise you forgot
something at the last spaceport it’s a huge pain to go back for it.  You’ll
likely want one means of propulsion optimised for high thrust (manoeuvre burns),
and another means of propulsion optimised for high specific impulse (efficient
long-distance acceleration). Even if you have access to high-energy-density fuel
sources like nuclear, ships in Terminal_IV can’t just go where they please. Get
your delta-v from infrastructure wherever possible (see the Zeroth Law).
Corollary: since delta-v is expensive, mass is too. Cargo and passengers cost
money. Don’t expect to be able to get passage on a ship for free, margins tend
to be tight.






The Second Law: See Travel In Terms Of Orbits And Gravity Wells You’re in orbit
when your ship’s velocity and the force of gravity pulling you towards an object
are balanced such that you continuously fall around the object instead of
falling into it or shooting off into space.  You’re almost always in orbit
around something (if you don’t think you’re orbiting anything, check if you’re
actually orbiting the Sun).  For a given radius from the centre of the object,
there’s a velocity at which the orbit is stable; the highest velocity orbit has
the lowest radius and vice-versa.  E.g. satellites in Low Earth Orbit like
Freestation Zarya travel at a higher velocity than Terminal_IV which is in a
higher (geostationary) orbit. They also complete more orbits in a day (16 vs 1).
The higher the radius, the weaker the pull of gravity. Higher-radius orbits are
considered “higher up the gravity well”, while lower-radius orbits are “lower
down”.  Somewhat counter-intuitively, you need to speed up to move to a higher
orbit, and slow down to move to a lower one.  To move to a higher orbit, burn
your engine to increase your velocity. You’re now moving faster than gravity can
pull you towards the object you’re orbiting, so you end up on an elliptical
transfer orbit taking you further away from the object than you were before.
Your velocity, temporarily increased by the burn, gradually decreases as you do
work to climb out of the gravity well. Despite the lower velocity, your ship has
more total energy as a result of the higher potential energy of the new orbit.
You may complete another burn at the furthest point (apogee) of the elliptical
orbit to circularise at a new orbit with a higher-radius and lower-velocity than
the original. It’s stable as even though you’re travelling slower, gravity is
weaker and you have further to fall.  To achieve the opposite effect and drop to
a lower orbit, burn your engines opposite your direction of travel to slow down.
Maybe you speed up so much you escape the gravity well altogether and go into
orbit around something else, or slow down so much you contact the thing you’re
orbiting.  When you move from one location in space to another, you’re putting
yourself into a transfer orbit; your origin and destination should be points on
that orbit.  E.g. departing from Terminal_IV in geostationary orbit and entering
a transfer orbit that will take you down to Freestation Zarya in Low Earth Orbit
is roughly the same process as departing Mars orbit and entering a transfer
orbit that will take you down to Earth orbit.  Changing velocity means expending
energy, which is expensive (see The First Law) so catch a lift up or down the
gravity well wherever you can (see The Zeroth Law). 

Orbit stuff is _weird_ but just remember you can’t increase or decrease speed
and keep the same orbit - to catch up to something you either need to go to a
higher orbit and wait for them to come back round or go down to a lower one,
overtake, and then burn back up to meet them


apoapsis/periapsis

burn radially/anti-radially




The Third Law: Space Is Big, Your Ships Are Slow Space is big[citation needed]
so everything’s very far away from everything else. Spaceships need to depart
well in advance of when they intend to arrive. Information only travels at the
speed of light, and ships travel much slower, so travel and trade are
characterised by lag.  Ships also need to be a certain size to fit in the life
support and propulsion requirements for that length of journey, so you’re
probably not doing interplanetary flight in a tiny two-seater transfer shuttle
(unless you’ve managed to accelerate it very fast indeed and have some way of
stopping at the other end (see The Seventh Law)).  Example travel times go here
- stations within Earth’s orbit like Kalpana Station, Freestation-Zarya;
interplanetary travel; far reaches of the solar system





The Fourth Law: Almost Nothing Does Re-entry Anymore The kinds of spaceships
which are efficient for interplanetary travel are not well-suited to the
business of atmospheric entry, and it’s not economical to use spaceships to move
mass up and down a gravity well when infrastructure is available (see the
Zeroth, First and Second Laws).  Generally, goods are transported up the gravity
well on elevators or skyhooks and then transshipped to continue their journey.
SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit) vehicles do exist, but are rare and generally used
for shuttling around high-paying personnel who want to skip the slow train ride
up the tether to orbit. Solar system bodies with weak gravity and little-to-no
atmosphere are routine to dock on for most kinds of spaceships, and the light
atmosphere and gravity of Mars see relatively frequent launches; the thick
atmosphere and strong gravity of Earth however make launches and landings there
a rare occurrence.






The Fifth Law: You Need Radiators Give your ship some damn radiators. Radiation
is like the only way to lose heat in space and your ship probably produces a lot
it needs to dissipate. The greater the radiators’ surface area, the better
they’ll dissipate the heat into the void.  They’re also beautiful if you
describe them right. More sci-fi should give ships radiators, for real. Be the
change you want to see and slap radiators on that ship. If you’re building a
stealth ship they won’t work though - see the bit of the book on stealth
steamers which use hydrogen/helium to cool their hull down to be undetectable
against background. 





The Sixth Law: Every Ship Is A Weapon Of Mass Destruction Authorities a) like to
know where every ship in the solar system is at all times and b) control who is
allowed to pilot those ships. Obviously the net has many holes: some places will
not recognise pilot accreditations from other places, some spaceports harbour
illegal and undocumented vessels, etc. Defence forces are all too happy to
intervene if you are behaving dangerously or erratically, and procuring a ship
legally is a difficult and long process.  Things in space move very fast, and
when even small pieces of debris collide with objects at orbital velocities bad
things happen. When it’s a whole spaceship acting as the impactor, even worse
things will happen (see The Seventh Law for a reminder of the importance of
being able to stop). Additionally, the line between “reactor” or “engine” and
“bomb” can be very blurred, and engine exhaust can be damaging in and of itself. 





The Seventh Law: Remember To Decelerate If you arrive at a destination without
decelerating first, you either become a weapon of mass destruction if you hit it
(see The Sixth Law) or can’t scrub enough speed to enter orbit and do an
embarrassing unplanned flyby. To avoid that, try to spend about half your
journey time accelerating, do a flip at the halfway point so you’re flying
backwards, and then use your main engines to decelerate back towards zero before
you arrive where you’re trying to go.  Coasting in the middle of the journey
rather than constantly accelerating will be slower but more fuel-efficient.
Unfortunately you will experience no gravity for the period you’re not running
the engine unless you have some kind of spin gravity setup (see The Eighth Law).
There’s not really much sense of direction in space so flying backwards isn’t
that weird.  If you decelerate too rapidly, for example by hitting something,
that’s probably fatal to all onboard for a number of different reasons.






The Eighth Law: You Get Gravity Only If You’re Spinning Or Under Thrust Magic
artificial gravity is banned, sorry. However, if your ship is arranged like a
skyscraper with vertically-stacked decks and the engines at the base, any time
you’re under constant linear acceleration of around 1g your characters can walk
around as on Earth.  You can assume this applies any time the engines are
providing thrust in a straight line, unless you’re accelerating aggressively, in
which case everything will feel much heavier than on Earth as if you’re in a
very fast lift.  If you’re not under thrust, you’ll need to spin the spaceship
to produce a fictitious force throwing you away from the spin axis, just like
how it works on Terminal_IV.  Some vessels’ habitable decks can swing so that
they can be arranged either perpendicular to the direction of travel while under
constant acceleration, or parallel to it to be spun up for spin gravity while
coasting. This is mostly only considered worth the extra mass of the mechanism
for extremely long journeys where accelerating the entire time is uneconomical
and the crew can’t just suck it up and deal with the weightless environment (see
The Ninth Law).





The Ninth Law: Interstellar Travel Is Its Own Weird Other Thing The first humans
are setting out to visit other stars. If you embark on such a journey, expect to
die en-route. Cryogenic suspension technology is in development, but it’s not
there yet. Interstellar is increasingly being seen as the next big opportunity
for expansion and profit now that the solar system has been extensively
colonised - but don’t let that trick you into thinking the solar system has been
in any way tamed (see The Tenth Law).






The Tenth Law: Space Is Dangerous While the dangers of hard vacuum are not
always as bad as you might think (the pressure differential between your
spaceship and the vacuum isn’t so great that small holes can cause the whole
vessel to explosively decompress or whatever, and you can survive hard vacuum
exposure for a few seconds to a minute just fine), many many things in space are
trying to kill you. Radiation, negative effects of microgravity, engineering
contracted out to the lowest bidder, etc. Paint spaceflight as inherently risky
and space itself as a threat.  Do not engage in space combat, it is not worth
it.  To repeat, it is absolutely NOT worth it. Everyone agrees that nothing good
can come of space combat and everyone tries to keep out of it as much as
possible. Having said that, almost all spaceships are armed to some extent and
if you do choose to engage in space combat, there is a section of this book full
of suggestions.
