[This is a version of the cyberware creation rules found in the **chip** downtime command reproduced here for convenience]

# 1) Imagine a cool piece of chrome that suits your character.
Don't even think about the game's mechanics at this point. Think of a cyberware idea you'd like your character to have in the fiction which they could feasibly have access to. Visualise it in action and hold it as an image in your head - no need to translate it to words yet.

# 2) Judge which category of cyberware your idea best fits into.

NOTE: These classes are NOT diegetic. They are a way to categorise cyberware by its mechanical costs and effects; as an in-fiction cyberware classification system it makes less than zero sense.

## Class C
Class C cyberware is mundane, legal, and not controlled by Terminal_IV's authorities. These kinds of body modifications are completely commonplace and will turn few heads. Class C cyberware includes:

- Cyberware which is completely routine in-setting, e.g. the standard neural integration/IO port suite common among Terminal_IV residents;
- Cyberware which addresses a disability and doesn't confer any significant extra fictional advantage, e.g. an artificial limb;
- Cosmetic customisations which offer no direct mechanical benefit (though they may occasionally impact position/effect), e.g. cat ears.

There’s usually no cost associated with Class C cyberware; however, if a character needs to acquire some and it’s been established in the fiction that they didn’t already have it (e.g. if their leg gets blown off and they need a cybernetic replacement) they will have to acquire it in a way that makes fictional sense, which may invole the cost of a **chip** downtime command. Outside of these edge cases, you can usually just establish in the fiction that your character has Class C cyberware whenever it becomes relevant in play; you can choose to go through the process of creating and recording it as outlined in the **chip** downtime command, but you don't have to.  

## Class B
Class B cyberware passively offers a specific fictional permission or mechanical advantage. Its functionality is "always-on". Access to Class B cyberware is often restricted by Terminal_IV's authorities, and many examples in this category are entirely illegal (doubly so if jailbroken). Class B breaks down into two subclasses:  

### Class B2
Class B2 cyberware provides the fictional effect of a physical item, but integrated into your body. 
Examples include wrist-mounted rocket launchers (which are essentially just a regular rocket launcher integrated with your body). 

### Class B1
Class B1 cyberware provides a fictional effect or mechanical advantage not easily accomplished with a physical item. 
Examples include

# Class A
