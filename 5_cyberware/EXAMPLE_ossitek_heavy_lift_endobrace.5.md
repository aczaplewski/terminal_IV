[Below is a version of the cyberware creation framework found in the **chip** downtime command]



Example cyberware configuration: Ossitek_M57_Heavy_Lift_Endobrace (based off Lewys' character idea)


# 1 Imagine a cool piece of chrome that suits your character.
Don't even think about the game's mechanics at this point. Think of a cyberware idea you'd like your character to have, which they could feasibly get hold of in the fiction. Visualise it in action and hold it as an image in your head - no need to translate it to words yet. Done that?

> Yes.

# 2 Judge which category of cyberware your idea best fits into.
See the class breakdown further down this file; delete the lines that don't apply.

> Class B: "always-on" cyberware which passively offers a specific fictional permission or mechanical advantage. When your cyberware offers you an advantage during an action roll, you may **leverage cyberware** to roll the Cyber Die.  

# 3 Descirbe what physical form your cyberware takes and where in your body it's located
E.g. chip, artificial limb, eye implant, etc

> A reinforced skeleton; nano-fibre-woven braces and big chunks of metal surround key parts of my skeleton, supporting the joints and reinforcing the bone. My tendons and ligaments are also replaced with stronger synthetic equivalents.

# 4 Describe in one or two sentences how your cyberware affects the fiction when it's in use.
It may help to compare your character's abilities when leveraging their cyberware to normal human limits. 

> I can lift much more weight than is humanly possible, and am extremely resistant to breaking bones on blunt force impact. 

# 5 Why did you end up with this cyberware?

> It's to help me lift stuff for my construction job and generally reduce the chance of dying on site.  

# 6 How did you acquire/pay for it?

> Company paid, they take it back if you quit or get fired, though. That or you gotta pay... not a lot of ex-construction workers

# 7 Provide a detail about your cyberware's installation process

> It's pretty invasive - big old scar down my spine. They basically do the same thing you do to fish cept you got arms and legs too

# 8 Who chipped you? How well do you know them? Are you still in contact?

# 9 What kind of maintenance does your cyberware need? Do you have to see a doc for that, or can you do it yourself?

NOTE: These classes are NOT diegetic. They are a way to categorise cyberware by its mechanical costs and effects; as an in-fiction cyberware classification system it makes less than zero sense.

## Class C
Class C cyberware is mundane, legal, and not controlled by Terminal_IV's authorities. These kinds of body modifications are completely commonplace and will turn few heads. Class C cyberware includes:

- Cyberware which is completely routine in-setting, e.g. the standard neural integration/IO port suite common among Terminal_IV residents;
- Cyberware which addresses a disability and doesn't confer any significant extra fictional advantage, e.g. an artificial limb;
- Cosmetic customisations which offer no direct mechanical benefit (though they may occasionally impact position/effect), e.g. cat ears.

There’s usually no cost associated with Class C cyberware; however, if a character needs to acquire some and it’s been established in the fiction that they didn’t already have it (e.g. if their leg gets blown off and they need a cybernetic replacement) they will have to acquire it in a way that makes fictional sense, which may invole the cost of a **chip** downtime command. Outside of these edge cases, you can usually just establish in the fiction that your character has Class C cyberware whenever it becomes relevant in play; you can choose to go through the process of creating and recording it as outlined in the **chip** downtime command, but you don't have to.  

## Class B
Class B: "always-on" cyberware which passively offers a specific fictional permission or mechanical advantage. Access to Class B cyberware is often restricted by Terminal_IV's authorities, and many examples in this category are entirely illegal (doubly so if jailbroken). 

Class B2 cyberware provides the fictional effect of a physical item, but integrated into your body. 
Examples include wrist-mounted rocket launchers (which are essentially just a regular rocket launcher integrated with your body). 

Class B1 cyberware provides a fictional effect or mechanical advantage not easily accomplished with a physical item. 
Examples include

## Class A
